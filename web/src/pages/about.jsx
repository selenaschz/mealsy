        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-600 pb-4">
          <span className="font-bold text-brown-dark">Mealsy</span> was created
          to solve a simple yet frustrating problem: deciding what to cook. We
          all know the struggle of standing in front of the fridge wondering
          what to make. This platform was born out of a love for food, a passion
          for programming, and a desire to make meal planning easier.

          Mealsy allows you to <Link to="/dishes" className="font-bold text-brown-dark"> filter </Link> recipes by your favorite cuisine, dietary preferences (for those with allergies or specific diets), 
          calories, preparation time, and more, so you can easily find the ideal dish.
